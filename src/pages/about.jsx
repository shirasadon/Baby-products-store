 <h3> Nice to meet you</h3>
  <p style={styleFont}>
  
We started our journey 10 years ago with a small store and a warm and beloved clientele, and today we are a leading chain in Israel for baby products, with 10 large and spacious branches nationwide, with several more branches under construction. We recently established a surplus branch located in Arova warehouses, which offers particularly attractive prices. In the surplus branch you can find products that were in branch displays, products whose packaging was damaged but the product inside is new and in good condition and more from a variety of our favorite products.

 

We lead sales directly from the importer of the most loved brands in the world - to the consumer, thus offering you affordable prices and a huge variety.

 

Behind this success - are you, our dear audience who choose us time and time again, when the reasons for this are many.

 

The most important value that leads us is the service to our customers, with the customer's best interest always in front of our eyes. We invest a lot of effort in operating a high-quality, professional and humane team, which is available to you in all media, for any question and request.

Besides the service, you will find with us fair prices, a variety of leading brands in the world, high-quality and sought-after products, and of course the most profitable promotions.

 

In our branches there are installers who have passed a course and have global certification for installing car safety seats. On our website, which is updated daily, you can place orders and receive them with extremely fast deliveries - to your home or to the nearest branch.

 The most fun is to buy at an affordable price and get full of surprises and treats packed in one package of personal service and lots of love.</p>
